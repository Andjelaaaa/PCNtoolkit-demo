# Hierarchical Bayesian Regression tutorial

This tutorial gives instruction on how to perform hierarchical bayesian regression on the FCON1000 dataset. This is really a toy example, because it does not use the normative_paralell.py functionality to split the processing across multiple nodes. However, it should give an overview of how to set up the different input files, for example showing how the batch effects ought to be configured.  

Further details including a walkthrough can be found in the python notebook

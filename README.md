# Normative modelling demo with PCNtoolkit
This repository contains a walk through of a normative modelling analytic pipeline using cortical thickness data from several public datasets. 

We will be running all of our code in Google Colab python notebooks. These are essentially Jupyter notebooks run in the :cloud: *cloud* :cloud:. 
Running our code using Colab will save us from dealing with python library installation and virtual environment setup. 

We will also be using the Pandas library for a lot of our code. There is a great intro to Pandas Colab notebook here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb)

When you are ready to run the analysis, you can launch the notebook below by clicking the 'Open in Colab' button. You need to be signed in to a Google account in your internet browser and for best results, use Chrome web browser.
